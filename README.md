# YelpApiExample
An android app that demonstrates how to create a basic activity that uses an intent service to make yelp api calls.

This application was created as an example for group #2 in CSC413 at San Francisco
State University Summer 2015.  In order to make calls to the yelp api, you will
need to register as a developer with yelp at https://www.yelp.com/developers,
obtain APIv2.0 credentials, and update the YelpRequestService.java file to use
them.
